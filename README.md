# C++ web server from scratch!
**Multiplexing for Non-Blocking**: To handle multiple clients concurrently without blocking, I implemented multiplexing. This allows for efficient utilization of resources and ensures the server can handle numerous requests simultaneously. 

**Support for Multiple HTTP Methods**: The server can handle various HTTP methods, including GET, POST, and DELETE, enabling the development of dynamic web applications with full CRUD functionality.

**File Uploads and Directory Listing**: Uploading files to the server is a breeze, and the server can list directory contents for easy navigation and file management.

**Multiple CGI Languages**: Supporting multiple CGI languages like PHP, Python, and C++, We've created a versatile platform for developing dynamic content that suits your language preference.

**Cookies and Sessions**: Ensuring robust authentication and authorization, we've integrated cookies and sessions to protect specific routes and provide a secure user experience.

**Error Handling**: A user-friendly experience is vital. The server handles error pages gracefully, ensuring users receive informative error messages when things go wrong.

**Diverse Status Codes**: The server responds with appropriate HTTP status codes, allowing for clear communication between the server and the client.
